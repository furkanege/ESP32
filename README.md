# ESP32 Projects Collection  
**Author:** Furkan Ege  
**License:** GPL-3.0  
**Status:** Public – Fully Open-Source

This repository contains my collection of **ESP32-based robotics and IoT projects**.  
All projects are organized by **project index and name**, following a clean and extensible directory structure (e.g. `01-bt_car_esp32/`, `02-smart_home_esp32/` etc.)

I believe **engineering must be transparent**, so every project -from early experiments to more advanced functional prototypes- is fully shared and openly accessible.

## 🚗 **Current Project Index**

- `01-bt_car_esp32`  
  4WD Bluetooth car powered by an ESP32 (Classic Bluetooth SPP) and dual L298N motor drivers.  
  Uses a 6× AA NiMH pack for motors and a USB powerbank for the ESP32 logic domain with a custom birch plywood chassis.

## 🧪 **Project Purposes**

Each project folder aims to include:

- Clean, well-structured **ESP32 Arduino code**
- Proper **English descriptions**
- Clear hardware and wiring explanations
- Notes on **power design and common pitfalls**
- Real-world use-case ideas and extension notes

The main goal is simple:  
> *Keeping robotics & IoT education accessible, transparent and reusable with real hardware, not just theory.*
